# Js Counter App

This is a very simple JS Vanilla Counter App. I made it so, I can cross-reference it with a Vue Counter App which I will build next.

## Installation

No installation is required. You can run this app simply by using the Live Server in your VSCode. Just open this js-counter-app directory in your VSCode, click on the Live-Server and you would be able to see the counter app in your Browser on the localhost.
